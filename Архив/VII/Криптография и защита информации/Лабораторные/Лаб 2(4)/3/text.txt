Health and development are intimately interconnected. Both insufficient development leading to 
poverty and inappropriate development resulting in overconsumption, coupled with an expanding world 
population, can result in severe environmental health problems in both developing and developed nations. 
Action items under Agenda 21 must address the primary health needs of the world's population, since they 
are integral to the achievement of the goals of sustainable development and primary environmental care. 
The linkage of health, environmental and socio-economic improvements requires intersectoral efforts. 
Such efforts, involving education, housing, public works and community groups, including businesses, 
schools and universities and religious, civic and cultural organizations, are aimed at enabling people 
in their communities to ensure sustainable development. Particularly relevant is the inclusion of 
prevention programmes rather than relying solely on remediation and treatment. Countries ought to 
develop plans for priority actions, drawing on the programme areas in this chapter, which are based 
on cooperative planning by the various levels of government, non-governmental organizations and local 
communities. An appropriate international organization, such as WHO, should coordinate these activities.
