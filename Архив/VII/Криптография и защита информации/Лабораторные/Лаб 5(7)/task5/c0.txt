Economic policies of individual countries and international economic relations both have
great relevance to sustainable development. The reactivation and acceleration of development 
requires both a dynamic and a supportive international economic environment and determined 
policies at the national level. It will be frustrated in the absence of either of these 
requirements. A supportive external economic environment is crucial. The development process 
will not gather momentum if the global economy lacks dynamism and stability and is beset with 
uncertainties. Neither will it gather momentum if the developing countries are weighted down 
by external indebtedness, if development finance is inadequate, if barriers restrict access 
to markets and if commodity prices and the terms of trade of developing countries remain 
depressed. The record of the 1980s was essentially negative on each of these counts and needs 
to be reversed. The policies and measures needed to create an international environment that 
is strongly supportive of national development efforts are thus vital. International 
cooperation in this area should be designed to complement and support - not to diminish or 
subsume - sound domestic economic policies, in both developed and developing countries, if 
global progress towards sustainable development is to be achieved. KONSTANTIN
